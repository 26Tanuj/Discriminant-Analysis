# Discriminant-Analysis
I created a discriminat model for next period prediction on ITC stock data.
Data is downloaded from yahoo finance of past 5 years .
Returns are calculated using LOG formula in excel sheet.
A dependent variable - 'Directon' is created with two categories.
Independent variable such as - "Lag1" "Lag2" "Lag3" "Lag4" "Lag5" and volume is also created .
Model is developed using python . 
All excel files are also attached in repository.
